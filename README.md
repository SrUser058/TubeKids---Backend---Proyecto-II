### How install?

You need Node.js or any runtime environment of Javascript in your computer, in this case I use npm, but you can use pnpm or any similar.



```
    npm install express

    npm install cors

    npm install dotenv

    npm install mongoose

```

And I recommend you install nodemon in case you test your changes while executing this API.

```
    npm instal nodemon
```

Also yo can download the Client Side created and updated by me in the next repository: [https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Frontend---Proyecto-II](https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Frontend---Proyecto-II)

If you don't install nodemon, you  wll need to create in the package.json file the command to execute the API in your environment.
